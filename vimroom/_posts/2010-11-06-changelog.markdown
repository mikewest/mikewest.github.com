*   Renaming the `<Plug>Vimroomize` mapping to `<Plug>VimroomToggle` (as
    `Vimroomize` is a silly name)

*   Adding a `:VimroomToggle` command that has the same effect as the 
    `<Plug>VimroomToggle` mapping.

*   Vertical padding is available now via the `g:vimroom_sidebar_height` 
    configuration option, which defaults to 3 lines.
