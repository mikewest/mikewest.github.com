*   Fixing the `g:colors_name` bug that [FND][] [found][].

*   Adding `g:vimroom_scrolloff` to configure the number of lines that must
    be shown before and after the cursor (using the built-in `scrolloff`
    setting).  Defaults to 999, which centers the cursor on the screen if
    enough lines are available.
