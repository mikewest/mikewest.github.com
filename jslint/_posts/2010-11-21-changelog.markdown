JSLint has an official GitHub presence!  Excellent!  I've reworked this
repository entirely so that it's based on the official repository, which
means that the `mirror` branch has been dropped entirely, and that all
the SHA1 IDs have changed.  If you've forked this repository, or stored
it locally for any reason at all, you'll run into problems.  Please
reclone and start over.

It's inconvenient, I know, but this will make it much simpler to keep in
step with changes in the official repo.
