PyPlaceholder
=============

<ul class="actions">
  <li><a href="http://github.com/mikewest/pyplaceholder/tarball/v0.5" class="cta">Download current version (v0.5)</a></li>

</ul>

When mocking up layouts, I want to ensure that the HTML I'm building wraps
_real_ images in the correct aspect ratios.  I also want to be able to fiddle
with the sizes without getting distracted by squashed/stretched faces or by
color schemes that are anethema to a particular design.  I'd
like something akin to a visual "Lorem ipsum...", that says "Hey!  An image
is going to go here!  At some point!  In the future!"  Importantly for some
future work, I want these images to be autogenerated.

So, `PyPlaceholder`.  Using [`PyPNG`][pypng] as a base, it generates s very
simple image that you can stick into a layout to hold the place of images 
to come.

They look like this:

<img src="./demo1.png" alt="Demonstration image goes here." width="600" height="337">

Or like this:

<img src="./demo2.png" alt="Demonstration image goes here." width="600" height="337">

I know, right?  Whatever width you'd like, whatever foreground, whatever
background.  It's like magic.
