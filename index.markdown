*   [`static_gettext`][static_gettext] is an internationalization framework
    for static, plaintext documents and templates. It's geared towards 
    straightforward translation of static websites, but can be easily used for
    any set of files you'd like to translate as a group.

*   [`jslint utils`][jslintutils] is a collection of scripts that wrap JSLint
    and Rhino, enabling easy linting on the command line, and automated reporting
    of linting errors via a continuous integration system like Hudson.
